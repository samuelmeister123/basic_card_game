# basic_card_game
This is my first programming project.

I want to build a basic card playing game with standard french cards, including the typical sets of Cards declared as colours HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS, CLUBS.
The cards values go from Ace(which should be used in the game like 1 and also like 14)2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Jack equals 11,Queen equals 12 and King 13.

To start of I am building a fixed array which includes one deck of Cards, 52 in total 13 of each colour.
To build the array i constructed several loops.

At the moment the programm cannot RUN. So I don't know if it works.

Can someone HELP ME! Help is very much appreciated.
